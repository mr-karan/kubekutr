üç™‚úÇÔ∏è _Cookie cutter for Kubernetes resource manifests_

`kubekutr` lets you quickly scaffold a [bespoke](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/glossary.md#bespoke-configuration) configuration for Kubernetes resource manifests with an _opinionated_ GitOps directory structure. `kubekutr` is ideally meant to be used in combination with [kustomize](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize).

Read the blog [post](https://mrkaran.dev/posts/introducing-kubekutr/) for more info. 

## Motivation

`kustomize` is a great tool when it comes to declarative application management for manifests. There still exists a lot of manual scaffolding to create a [base](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/blob/master/docs/glossary.md#base) which defines your application state. `kubekutr` aims to solve the issue of writing these manifests manually by providing a very simple Go template rendering engine. 

### Non Goals

`kubekutr` doesn't aim to provide all 1000s of options of templating `yaml` files. More users mean every user will want to customise the `yaml` in some way or the other and this is where `kustomize` comes into picture. Users of `kubekutr` are encourage to use `kustomize` to create _variants_ on top of `bases` to apply any kind of customisation. `kubekutr`'s **only** goal is to create the _base_ directory.
